# BerlinClock

I've created simple solution that fullfils given critera, and I just wanted to comment that it could be extended with feature like error logging, custom error type, dependency injection etc. but I understood that it was not the goal of this excerise.'
Also I didn't create separate unit test project, but insted add few additional scenarios in Gherkin to alraedy existing once, assuming that for this application, BDD aproche was choosen instead of i.e. TDD with unit tests, so I didn't want to mix two styles'
Additionally I've made two small changes to the originally provided source code, which I explain in comments.
